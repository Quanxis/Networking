Internet Link Failure on BR2:

After shutting down gig1/0 on BR2, PC-BR2 can still access the Internet (ping 8.8.8.8) through HQ2.
Turned gig1/0 back on BR2 before proceeding to the next test.
MPLS Failure:

After suspending both PE-CE links, PC1 to PC-BR1 traffic now goes through the GRE+IPSec tunnel between HQ2 and BR2.
PC1 and PC-BR2 communication is still functional after MPLS failure.
